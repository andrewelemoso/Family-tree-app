Good day to all my Iyekans! Someone asked me through a private chat this morning; who’s this guy(one of us) and how related he is to us all.
His question prompted me to want to share the little I know about the Adesina-Sobowale dynasty with you all for posterity sake. Please note that whatever I’m sharing is what I’m privileged to have heard, have been told and limited to what I know.
Please feel free to add/correct me if necessary where names are not properly mentioned or omitted.

The children of the two are Anton Kolawole, Antonia kikelomo and Andrew Kolade Elemoso.

Kindly note the following:
Iya Agba was the last wife of Late Pa Otajejo Sobowale the grand patriarch of the Sobowale dynasty.
Baba Ogboye, the father of our own illustrious Prof. Idowu Sobowale, was the first born of Pa Otajejo while my mother Abeni was the last born.
Pa Otajejo was a sojourner from Remo who after finding his love of life in Abeokuta chose to make Abeokuta his home. More of this I will share with you on the Sobowale Ilawo platform.

The Durojaiyes are related to us from the Adesina compound in Ilawo. The father of Late Atanda Durojaiye, Baba Segun of Agbokojo ibadan , was actually named Durojaiye Adesina. He was half brother to Iya Agba and Iya kekere. After the death of Pa Durojaiye Adesina when his children were still young , mama kekere accepted to raise one of his children, a son and her nephew, Late Atanda Durojaiye as her own. 
So Late Pa Atanda Durojaiye was a cousin to our five original fathers and mothers.
Please feel free to add and forgive me where omissions are made as I stand to be corrected. Now you know where you belong. 
I will implore the IT gurus amongst us to help us develop the Adesina-Sobowales family tree with the five main branches, the Durojaiye connection and the sub branches.
Do have a pleasant first Sunday of November and remember to pray for us all. Ire o
